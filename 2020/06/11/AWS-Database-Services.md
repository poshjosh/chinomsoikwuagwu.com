__Amazon Aurora__

Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible relational database engine

- Distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system
- Auto-scales up to 64TB per database instance.
- Up to 15 low-latency read replicas
- Point-in-time recovery
- Continuous backup to Amazon S3
- Replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).

__Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)__

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate,
and scale a relational database in the cloud.

- Provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity
- Automates time-consuming administration tasks such as: hardware provisioning,
database setup, patching and backups.
- Six engines: `Amazon Aurora`, `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `MariaDB`,
`Oracle Database`, and `SQL Server`.

__Amazon RDS on VMware__

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
on VMware lets you deploy managed databases in on-premises VMware environments using the Amazon RDS technology

Achieve __low cost hybrid__ by replicating RDS on VMware databases to RDS instances
in AWS. This could be used for `disaster recovery`, `read replica bursting`, and
optional `long-term backup` retention in Amazon S3.

__Amazon DynamoDB__

Amazon DynamoDB is a `fully managed` key-value and document database that can
handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and support peaks of more than
20 million requests per second. DynamoDB delivers:

- Single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
- Multiregion, multimaster database  
- Built-in security, backup and restore
- In-memory caching for internet-scale applications.

_Use cases: mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and other applications that
need low-latency data access at any scale_

__Amazon ElastiCache__

Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate,
and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud.

Supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:

- __Amazon ElastiCache for Redis__ is a `Redis`-compatible `fully managed` in-memory service

 - Both single-node and up to 15-shard clusters are available
 - Scalability to up to 3.55 TiB of in-memory data.
 - Scalable, and secure.

 _Use cases: high-performance use cases such as web, mobile apps, gaming, ad-tech, and IoT._

- __ElastiCache for Memcached__ is protocol compliant with `Memcached`, so
popular tools that you use today with existing Memcached environments will work
seamlessly with the service.

__Amazon Neptune__

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, `fully managed` graph database service that
makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.

- Read replicas, point-in-time recovery,
- Continuous backup to Amazon S3
- Replication across Availability Zones.
- Support for encryption at rest.
- Supports popular graph models `Property Graph` and W3C's `RDF`, and their
respective query languages `Apache TinkerPop Gremlin` and `SPARQL`

_Use cases: recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug
discovery, and network security._

__Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)__

Amazon QLDB is a `fully managed` ledger database that provides a transparent,
immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log â€Žowned by a central
trusted authority. Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change
and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.

- Provides developers with a familiar SQL-like API
- Flexible document data model
- Full support for transactions.
- Automatically scales to support the demands of your application.

__Amazon Timestream__

Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database
service for IoT and operational applications that makes it easy to store and
analyze trillions of events per day at 1/10th the cost of relational databases

Automates rollups, retention, tiering, and compression of data, so you can
manage your data at the lowest possible cost.

_Use cases: analyze log data for DevOps, sensor data for IoT applications,
and industrial telemetry data for equipment maintenance._

__Amazon DocumentDB__

Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fast, scalable, highly
available, and `fully managed` document database service that `supports MongoDB workloads`.

Use your existing MongoDB drivers and tools with Amazon DocumentDB.

_Use case: operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads at scale._
